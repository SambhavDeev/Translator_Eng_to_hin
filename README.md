# Translator_Eng_to_hin
In this model we have used Seq2Seq model for creating Language translator fron english to hindi 
#Dataset
The data set we used in this project is not that big therefore to improve the accuracy we need a dataset which have much much more data in it 
#Accuracy 
to improve accuracy we can used another model that is Transformer model which is more complex then the seq2seq model but it has more accuracy than the seq2seq model or we can use different data set which links are provided in below.
